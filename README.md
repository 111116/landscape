# Landscape

The landscape scene from [Scenes for pbrt-v3](https://pbrt.org/scenes-v3.html) converted to obj (ascii) with json scene description. The scene structure is flattened (no nested attributes, no explicit instancing).

> landscape: Very complex realistic outdoor landscape scene, featuring 23,241 unique plant models. Thanks to object instancing, the scene has a total geometric complexity of 3.1 billion triangles, even though only 24 million triangles need to be stored in memory. `view-0.pbrt` is the cover image of the third edition of the *Physically Based Rendering* book. Many thanks to Jan-Walter Schliep, Burak Kahraman, and Timm Dapper from [Laubwerk](http://www.laubwerk.com/) for this amazing scene, which is available under a [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license. 

### Notes

FOV is converted from vertical to horizontal.
